This went over well. Finished 4 minutes early so it would be more difficult to do with more than 19 students. 
I used BINGO to keep students attentive during each others slide presentations. I bribed them with a $5 gift card 
to Starbucks. The line was too long for me to get a physical card before class, so I told them I would email it. 
Bad plan -- 4 people said BINGO at the same time. ALWAYS DO A PHYSICAL REWARD.
